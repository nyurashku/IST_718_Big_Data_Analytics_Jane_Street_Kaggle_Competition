## Project Overview

Financial markets are notoriously complex and fiercely competitive. According to economic theory, any profit opportunity created by arbitrage is likely to be discovered quickly and eroded to zero as more market participants rush in to exploit it. In an era of unprecedented access to information, it can be argued that finding true alpha—an investing “edge”—has become nearly impossible without industrial-scale data mining and sophisticated predictive models. Wall Street quant shops such as Jane Street, Millennium, and Citadel dominate the CTA space by employing top PhDs and math Olympiad winners to sift through massive datasets in search of signals that yield elusive market advantages. In this project, despite not having access to the same level of cutting-edge infrastructure, we aim to develop a machine learning model to forecast responder_6, predicting its behavior up to six months into the future. Our goal is to demonstrate that even with more modest resources, thoughtful methodology and careful modeling can still provide valuable insights.
The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition hosted by Jane Street Group, a global proprietary trading firm. It consists of time-series financial data with 92 anonymized columns representing features and responders. The dataset has 47,127,338 rows. One of the biggest challenges of this project is the anonymization of responder_6, which forces our team to rely solely on data-driven insights. The actual Kaggle competition is also ongoing. The highest R² score on the leaderboard is only 0.012932. This low of an R² score demonstrates how difficult it is to find meaningful predictive patterns in financial data. This also reflects the reality of quantitative trading, where the smallest predictive advantage can lead to an edge over the competition.
Our primary project goal is to identify patterns within the Jane Street dataset, identify the key features influencing responder_6, and forecast responder_6 up to six months into the future.

## Data & Sources

The data used for this project is from a Jane Street hosted Kaggle competition which can be found here: The data used [Kaggle: Jane Street Real-Time Market Data Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-real-time-market-data-forecasting).

All data resources have been downloaded and added to this github too in case the data will not longer be available after the competition ends.
